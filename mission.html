    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <span>
        First off, welcome to F1 WRLD! My motivation when creating this website
        was simple - to unify the fans of Formula One! Since I am also one of them,
        I decieded that opening a website will be a simple and very effective way
        of doing exactly that!

      <h3>Functionality</h3>
      <span>
        To get the most of this webpage, use the navigation and switch to the
        racing data page. There, you will be able to find details about your
        favourite racers, recent Grand Prix, constructors, circuits and more!

      <h3>Future</h3>
      <span>
        As the webpage grows I intend to add more and more functionality over time,
        this includes but is not limtied to a discussion forum, community-made
        tierlists, fun clips and videos as well as interviews with the racers
        themselves!
